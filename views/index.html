        <h2>What is Node.js?</h2>
        <p>
            Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript
            engine.
        </p>
        <h2>What is a JavaScript runtime?</h2>
        <p>
            A runtime is a program that runs a program written in a specific
            language. In this case, Node.js is a program that runs JavaScript
            code.
        </p>
        <h2>What is Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine?</h2>
        <p>
            V8 is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by The Chromium
            Project for Google Chrome and Chromium web browsers. V8 compiles
            JavaScript code to native machine code instead of interpreting it or
            executing it as bytecode.
        </p>
        <h2>What can I do with Node.js?</h2>
        <p>
            Node.js is commonly used for backend services, APIs, and
            microservices. It is also used to build command-line tools and desktop
            applications.
        </p>
        <h2>What is npm?</h2>
        <p>
            npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. It puts
            modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency
            conflicts intelligently.
        </p>
        <h2>What is a package?</h2>
        <p>
            A package is a file or directory that is described by a package.json
            file. A package must contain a package.json file in order to be
            published to the npm registry.
        </p>
        <h2>What is a module?</h2>
        <p>
            A module is any file or directory in the node_modules directory that
            can be loaded by the Node.js require() function.
        </p>
        <h2>What is a dependency?</h2>
        <p>
            A dependency is a local package that a package.json file depends on.
        </p>
        <h2>What is a devDependency?</h2>
        <p>
            A devDependency is a package that is only necessary for local
            development and testing.
        </p>
        <h2>What is a peerDependency?</h2>
        <p>
            A peerDependency is a package that is only used when your package is
            installed as a dependency of another package.
        </p>
        <h2>What is a global dependency?</h2>
        <p>
            A global dependency is a package that is installed globally on your
            operating system.
        </p>
        <h2>What is a semantic version?</h2>
        <p>
            A semantic version is a version number that consists of three numbers
            separated by periods. The first number is the major version, the
            second number is the minor version, and the third number is the patch
            version.
